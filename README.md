# speech_to_text
This project is a real-time speech-to-text web application built using React with Next.js and Material UI (MUI). It integrates Deepgramâ€™s WebSocket API to transcribe live audio streams in various languages. Users can select a language, record their voice, and view the real-time transcription. The interface is enhanced using Material UI with responsive design and intuitive controls.
